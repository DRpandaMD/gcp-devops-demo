## Environment Set up

* ensure you environment can push / pull into github
* I am using Google Cloud Shell so the set up is quite minimal

## App Set up

* See `/sample-app/`
* I asked my ChatGPT Software Engineer Persona for the code you see

## GCP Artifact Registry Setup

* there are a series of steps here that also include making a service account to act as a creditial helper for docker to push to GCP Artifact Registry on our behalf.

* This is very similar to creating a helper service account for a terraform builder helper
